This is group 5 carrying out the project in II1302, VT22

## The project

* Background
An imaginary customer wants a cloud-based system for monitoring air quality / temperature. They want to be able to put out sensors in different rooms and connect them all to a common service in the cloud, where the data is displayed.

* Purpose
The overall purpose of this project is to protect human health and equipment. The product can provide incentives to lower the concentration of carbon dioxide in the workplace to improve the work environment.
The project will also give the group experience in projects and system development.

* Goal
The main goal is to develop a functioning system that meets the requirements. Some sub-goals are: a functional sensor module, integration with the cloud and a functional web interface.

## Development

### Webpage

To develop the webpage, do the following:

- Install Node and npm.
- From the root directory, run `npm install`. This installs all dependencies, including those of the `web/` subpackage, into `node_modules/`.
- `npm run dev` to start a live development server on localhost.
- Develop. ðŸ˜Ž
- `npm test` to run all unit tests.
- The `.husky/pre-commit` git hook runs Prettier and ESLint on any staged files before every commit.

### Hardware
